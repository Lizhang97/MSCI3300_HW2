          <h3> Hometown </h3>
          <p> I was born in a coastal city called Wenling in China. Since I can only go back there occasionally, it is always adorable and warm in my memory. When I was a month old, my family moved to another city called Changzhou, where I have spent most of my life so far.

          <p> I am major in Business Analytics, but I also plan to finish the information Systems track. I also have a philosophy minor. These all interest me. Actually, knowledge interests me.
